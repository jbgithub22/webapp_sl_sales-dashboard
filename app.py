    Our journey is broken down into two main phases, accessible via the sidebar on the left:

    ### ðŸ“Š Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    We begin by understanding our foundation: 
    * **Global Reach:** Where are our customers, and what is their purchasing power?
    * **Inventory Health:** What products are selling, and are we managing stock efficiently?
    * **Financial Pulse:** How do our employees and payment dynamics affect our bottom line?

    ### ðŸ§  Phase 2: Machine Learning Solutions
    We then tackle critical business challenges with predictive modeling:
    * **Customer Churn:** Identifying at-risk customers for targeted retention.
    * **Product Recommendations:** Suggesting the next best item for customers to boost sales.
    * **Credit Risk:** Quantifying the risk associated with extending credit to maintain financial health.
